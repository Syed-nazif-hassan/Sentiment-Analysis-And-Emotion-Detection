# Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection for Business-H

## This project analyzes fictional opinions about a fictional company, Business-H, using transformers for both sentiment analysis and emotion detection. The implementation is done in Python.

### The opinions are stored in a file called business_H.txt, which contains 100 sentences. Each sentence is classified into one of the following sentiment categories: Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Very Negative. Then, emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Fear, and Neutral are identified for each sentence.

### Finally, the total count of sentences in each sentiment category, as well as the count of each emotion type within those sentiment groups, is displayed.
